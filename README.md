## spot(1)

Tiny ack-style file search utility.

### Features

* Short & written in Bash: you can edit it easily to suit your liking.
* Fast. Just `find` + `grep` + `awk`.
* Searches most things by default instead of some known predefined extensions.
* Ignores .git, .hg, .svn, devices and binary files.

### Usage

#### Smart phrases

All arguments constitute the search text. No need to wrap most searches
in double quotes.

#### Smart case

`spot` is case-insensitive by default. However, if your search term
contains an uppercase letter, it becomes sensitive!

#### Smart targets

If the first argument contains a slash _and_ is a valid directory, the
search is constrained to that particular target.

#### Wildcard matching

In `spot(1)` searches, the `.` character acts as the RegExp wildcard,
making it very easy to perform searches that match anything, and to avoid
escaping characters or including ones that are not necessary for your
search.

#### Line abbreviation

If the line where matches are found is too long (such as minified source files),
`spot(1)` will only display the surrounding characters.

#### Options

`spot -h` to see them.

### Installation

If you have NPM:

```
$ npm install -g spot
```

Or if you have [bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg)

```
$ bpkg install -g spot
```

You're done! Otherwise, run this command:

```
curl -L https://raw.github.com/rauchg/spot/master/spot.sh -o ~/bin/spot && chmod +x ~/bin/spot
```

If you don't have `~/bin`, replace it with another directory in your
`$PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin`.
